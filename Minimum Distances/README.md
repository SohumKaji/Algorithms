*******************
*Minimum Distances*
*******************

	"Consider an array of n integers, A. The distance between two indices, i and j, is denoted by |i-j|.
	Given A, find the minimum d_ij such that a_i == a_j and i != j. In other words, find the minimum 
	distance between any pair of equal elements in the array. If no such value exists, print -1."
